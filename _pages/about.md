I am currently an Assistant Professor (Tenure-Track) in Power Economics and Technology Research Institute (PETRI) and the group leader of Smart Grid and Electricity Market (SMART), School of Electrical Engineering, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), China. I am also affiliated with [Tampere University](https://www.tuni.fi/en), Finland, working as an adjunct researcher. My research interests are about demand side management, demand response, electricity market and machine learning applications in power systems. Before joining in Southeast University, I worked as a Postdoctoral Associate with Prof. Saifur Rahman in [Advanced Research Institute (ARI)](https://ari.vt.edu/), Virginia Tech, Washington D.C., USA, 2018-2019. I also worked as an Intern Engineer in Global Energy Interconnection Research Institute North America (GEIRINA), California, USA, 2017-2018 and Project Researcher in Tampere University of Technology, Finland, 2013-2015. I received my BSc, MSc and PhD from Anhui University, China, 2008-2012, Tampere University of Technology, Finland, 2012-2015 and University of Michigan, USA, 2015-2018, respectively, all in Electrical Engineering. 

I received the Best Paper Award for IEEE ISGT-Asia 2019, IEEE iSPEC 2021, IEEE CIEEC 2022 and the Best Reviewer Award for IEEE Transaction on Smart Grids 2020. I was a Guest Editor for Frontiers in Energy Research, Frontiers In Smart Grids and World Electric Vehicle Journal, has (co)authored more than 80 publications and PI for many R&D projects, including National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, and Science and Technology Project of the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC).
