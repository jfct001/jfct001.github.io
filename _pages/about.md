I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor on Tenure-Track) in Power Economics and Technology Research Institute (PETRI), School of Electrical Engineering, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), China. I am also affiliated with [Tampere University](https://www.tuni.fi/en), Finland, working as an adjunct researcher. My research interests are about demand side management, demand response, electricity market and machine learning applications (especially reinforcement learning applications) in power systems. Before joining in Southeast University, I worked as a Postdoctoral Associate with Prof. Saifur Rahman in [Advanced Research Institute (ARI)](https://ari.vt.edu/), Virginia Tech, Washington D.C., USA, 2018-2019. I also worked as an Intern Engineer in Global Energy Interconnection Research Institute North America (GEIRINA), California, USA, 2017-2018 and Project Researcher in Tampere University of Technology, Finland, 2013-2015. I received my BSc, MSc and PhD from Anhui University, China, 2008-2012, Tampere University of Technology, Finland, 2012-2015 and University of Michigan, USA, 2015-2018, respectively, all in electrical engineering.
