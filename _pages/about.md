I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor on Tenure-Track) in Power Economics and Technology Research Institute (PETRI), School of Electrical Engineering, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), China. My research interests are about demand side management, demand response, electricity market and machine learning applications (especially reinforcement learning applications) in power systems. Before joining in Southeast University, I worked as a Postdoctoral Associate with Prof. Saifur Rahman in Advanced Research Institute (ARI), Virginia Tech, Washington D.C., USA, 2018-2019. I also worked as an Intern Engineer in Global Energy Interconnection Research Institute North America (GEIRINA), California, USA, 2017-2018 and Project Researcher in Tampere University of Technology, Finland, 2013-2015. I received my BSc, MSc and PhD from Anhui University, China, 2008-2012, Tampere University of Technology, Finland, 2012-2015 and University of Michigan, USA, 2015-2018, respectively, all in electrical engineering.
